Hey, I'm Taylor, an engineer who enjoys finding ways to automate the boring things.

I like to find unique solutions to problems that make use of the existing infrastructure in outside-of-the-box ways.

I spend a lot of my time outside of work tinkering with new technologies in my home lab. I find it's much easier to build and experiment outside the confines of production, and it allows me to keep my skills sharp in the areas that I don't administer in the day-to-day at work.
