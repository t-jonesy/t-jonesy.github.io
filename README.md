Hey, I'm Taylor, a network and systems engineer who enjoys finding ways to automate "the boring things."

I spend a lot of my time outside of work tinkering with new technologies in my home lab. I find it's much easier to build and experiment outside the confines of production, and it allows me to keep my skills sharp in the areas that I don't administer in the day to day at work.

My current setup is:
    - pfSense Firewall running HAProxy
    - Supermicro X9DRH-IF 36-Bay
      - 160TB of usable storage in various ZFS pools
      - 2 Xeon E5-2660
      - 128GB RAM
    - ESXi Hypervisor
      - TrueNAS VM with LSI SAS controller in PCIe Passthrough
      - 2x Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS VM's serving as container hosts
